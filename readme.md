Blackjack in C++

This is blackjack in C++ as simple as that! In my on-going game dev journey I thought it would be a fun cool project, I've made one in Java already but wanted to get myself more proficient in C++, so this is a great project to persue. Everyone loves blackjack.

I intend to make a fully working interface with this game, and adding features such as doubling down, splitting, etc... Essentially the full game. 

Feel free to take the code and do whatever you want with it. 

Update(s) to come: 
- Add chips so the player can bet
- Implement doubling down, splitting, etc...
- Implement a game interface
